The latter is easier to get hold of, but bucatine thanks to its central hole has a lovely textural bounce. This does however make it a little more delicate. As for the variety of cured pork you can use, guanciale is traditional but might be overpowering to some tastes - it's almost oppressively reminiscent of farmyards and pigs. Pancetta is a little less hardcore. Both of these can be relatively expensive and difficult to source; the supermarket pancetta in little plastic tubs isn't pancetta at all. If streaky bacon is all you have to hand it'll do a reasonable job. As for the cooking method, like the fantastic Molly Baz I highly recommend using a double boiler rather than a pan over a direct heat, it's a far more reliable way of getting that beautiful creamy carbonara sauce. Finally, a top tip: twisting the bowl as you add the pasta (rather than the tongs) helps get the nest effect people are into."

      "authorabout": "Hugh's culinary life began aged 14 when he cooked spaghetti hoop burritos to impress girls. Since then his colourful career has taken him to performing in Skegness, making cheese in Peckham, running a wine bar on Columbia Road and reluctantly working in a (briefly) Michelin Starred restaurant. He likes fish, things cooked on charcoal, cheap dinners and London's rich cultural tapestry of food shops. When he's not cooking or eating he can be found mudlarking by the river Thames, buying bits in flea markets and hanging out with his cat Keith.",

He likes fish, things cooked on charcoal, cheap dinners and London's rich cultural tapestry of food shops.

Since then his colourful career has taken him to performing in Skegness, making cheese in Peckham, running a wine bar on Columbia Road and reluctantly working in a (briefly) Michelin Starred restaurant. He likes fish, things cooked on charcoal, cheap dinners and London's rich cultural tapestry of food shops. When he's not cooking or eating he can be found mudlarking by the river Thames, buying bits in flea markets and hanging out with his cat Keith.",

          "text": "Walkers and Heinz have teamed up to release a bunch of new crisp flavours, and we wanna try them all.All the Walkers flavours are inspired by popular British sarnie flavours, and you might like the idea of some more than others.One such example is the new Roast Chicken and Heinz Mayo flavour – roast chicken crisps aren't new, but the addition of mayo? That's sure to rile people.Another is Heinz and Walkers' Sausage Sarnie and Ketchup, which sounds pretty lovely to us.Perhaps the most divisive (but exciting for us) is the Cheese Toastie with Heinz Beanz flavour. You heard us... baked bean flavoured crisps.The flavours are available in supermarkets right now, with 45g grab bags costing a quid, while multipacks of five set you back just £1.65.Stockists include Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Co-op, Iceland, Aldi, B&M, Farmfoods, TJs, and Poundland, so you're bound to have somewhere selling them nearby.The products are limited-edition, and we don't yet know how long they'll be around, so we suggest stocking up while you can.Wayne Newton from Walkers said in a statement: We can’t think of a better way to kick start our CrispIN vs CrispOUT debate this year than by uniting with one of Britain’s favourite household names to take lunchtimes to a whole new level."

We're talking Jaffa Cakes, soy sauce and even piccalilli...That’s what’s on offer at fashion designer Anya Hindmarch’s Belgravia pop-up, The Ice Cream Project – and after a trip to the parlour for the last two years in a row, we decided it was only right we popped down again, to see what 2024's offering had to say for itself.We wouldn't blame you if you were horrified at the thought of condiment-inspired ice creams (and in many cases, you'd be justified). But the fun of Anya Hindmarch's pop-up is that quite often, ice creams that aren't meant to work just do. Keep reading for Twisted editor, Joanna's, very honest review. Who knows?

This is one is actually a returning entrant, so I actually tried it a couple of years ago, but the nerves still kicked in as I was served up a fresh scoop.There was certainly a distinctly ‘baked-beany’ flavour to this one, but the primary taste was tomato, and that, alongside the sweetness of the ice cream, kind of dominated over anything else.This could have been palatable if it wasn't for the frozen baked bean which emerged on my spoon (you heard me, there's actual beans in there...)Would you order this for anything other than novelty value? Absolutely not. But was it horrid? Also no.Those who like beans should definitely try it for a laugh – although, maybe not on toast.Penguin Ice Cream"
